# Documentation (WIP)
## Initialising the script
1. Place an anvil and get a stick
2. Name the stick "Selecc"
"Selecc" will be like a wand that you can use to select points and volumes you want to edit.
After doing so, you are now allowed to use commands such as the help command.

## Commaand Info
Unlike Minecraft's vanilla commands which uses the prefix "/", due to limitaions, the command prefix for this addon is "."
Examples of using commands:
```
.help
.age
```

### Command structure
The command structure for this script is almost identical to Minecraft's vanilla commands. Which is
```
"prefix" + cmd[0] + cmd[1] + ... + cmd[n]
```
There also exist sub-commands for more complex commands like set, gen, and shape.
